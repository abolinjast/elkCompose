Docker Compose manifest for running ELK stack 

**I would only use it for personal testing purposes and my monitoring habit as it is not fully production ready!**

Version: 8.17.0
For testing purposes, you can modify logstash pipelines in /usr/local/share/pipelines/
Remember to give logstash access to it through docker volumes.
